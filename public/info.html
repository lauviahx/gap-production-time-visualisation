            <h1>Project report for <i>"production time analysis" </i></h1>
<br>
            <p id="report">I currently work as the administrator in a caravan and motorhome manufacturing company where
                I’m engaged with data analysis every day, hence I decided to create a data visualisation related to my
                workplace. A part of my daily duties is to record daily production efficiency outcomes across four lines
                and two shifts, which includes for example logging quantities made and production downtime planned and
                unplanned.<br></p>
                <p id="report">
                My workplace is currently going through multiple organisation changes, where I feel like the management
                is not assigning the root issue when implementing solutions. The company is currently considering
                decreasing the capacity of evening shift as “we do not require as much production time to fulfil current
                targets”.<br>
                While recording the figures I noticed multiple times a “gap” between logged data and full available time
                for the shift. This is why I decided that "production gap" visualisation tool could be a practical and
                beneficial project idea.<br>
                The “gap” can be either positive or negative value and can indicate: <br>
                • Incorrect run time for specific models <br>
                • Set changeover time longer/shorter than required <br>
                • Incorrect team leader documentation. <br>
                I would like the outcome of my project to be able to showcase lead to further analyse if the management
                statement is correct - if “gap” time is unprofitable or is it just incorrectly documented data. <br></p>
                <p id="report">For the data source, I used existing numbers from the group of Excel spreadsheets I administrate at
                work. I decided to start with visualising the past two weeks of production. User data input contains
                multiple records from production day, which are used to calculate the production “gap" time and team
                efficiency percentage. The data is displayed in four stacked and grouped bar charts, one for each
                production line; I believe this is the best way to visualise production times data, as it executes clear
                outcome. The filter function of presented information by date has been also added to improve analysis
                effectiveness.
